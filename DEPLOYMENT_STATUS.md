## 📋 Deployment Error Analysis

### Error Reported
```
Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: 
https://boswelldigitalsolutions.com/icons/icon-192.png 
(Download error or resource isn't a valid image)
```

### Root Cause
The deployed site is showing an **older cached version** that had incorrect icon paths:
- Old: `/icons/icon-192.png` (incorrect)
- New: `/icons/icon-192x192.png` (correct)

### Current Status
✅ **Local build is correct** - All icon paths match the actual files
✅ **GitHub is up to date** - Latest commit includes all fixes
⚠️ **Deployed site may be cached** - May need cache invalidation

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Build locally** (already done):
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

2. **Deploy dist/ folder** to your hosting provider

3. **Clear cache** on hosting provider:
   - Netlify: Settings → Deploys → Clear cache and redeploy
   - Vercel: Deployments → Redeploy
   - Cloudflare: Purge cache
   - Browser: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## ✅ Summary

✅ **Local build is perfect** - All files correct, all paths valid
✅ **GitHub is up to date** - Latest commit pushed
⚠️ **Deployed site needs refresh** - May be showing cached old version

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
