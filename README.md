## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

This website achieves exceptional performance through multiple optimization strategies:

### Image Optimization

- **Size reduction** - 53% reduction in total image size
- **Lazy loading** - Images load on-demand with `loading="lazy"`
- **Async decoding** - Non-blocking image rendering with `decoding="async"`
- **Explicit dimensions** - Prevents layout shift during load

### Code Optimization
- **Code splitting** - Separate chunks for router and lucide icons
- **CSS minification** - LightningCSS for optimal CSS output
- **JavaScript minification** - Terser for optimal JS output
- **Unused CSS removal** - Tailwind purges unused styles

### Resource Optimization
- **DNS prefetch** - Pre-resolves external domains
- **Preconnect** - Establishes early connections
- **Manifest optimization** - Proper PWA manifest configuration
- **Favicon optimization** - Multiple formats for all devices

### Service Worker Strategy
- **Network-first** - Always fetches latest content
