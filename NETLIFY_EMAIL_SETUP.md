# Netlify Form Email Notifications Setup

## üéØ Overview

Netlify automatically detects form submissions and can send email notifications to your inbox. This guide walks you through setting it up.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Deploy to Netlify

Your site must be deployed to Netlify for form handling to work. If not already done:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Build settings:
   - **Build command**: `bun run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

---

## üìß Step 2: Enable Email Notifications (UI Method)

### Option A: Via Netlify Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to your site on [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Navigate to **Forms** ‚Üí **Settings**
3. Under "Form notifications", click **Add notification**
4. Select **Email notification**
5. Enter your email: `charlesboswell@boswelldigitalsolutions.com`
6. Click **Save**

**That's it!** You'll now receive emails for every form submission.

### Option B: Via netlify.toml (Already Configured)

The `netlify.toml` file in your repo already has form configuration:

```toml
[[forms]]
  name = "contact"
```

This tells Netlify to monitor the "contact" form. Email notifications are configured via the dashboard.

---

## üì¨ What You'll Receive

When someone submits the contact form, you'll get an email with:

- **Submission ID** - Track the submission
- **Timestamp** - When it was submitted
- **All form fields**:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Company
  - Message
  - Selected Package (ID, Name, Price)
  - Project Type
  - Budget
  - Timeline

---

## üîß Advanced: Webhook Notifications (Optional)

For more control, you can use webhooks to send data to external services:

### Slack Notifications

1. Create a Slack webhook URL
2. In Netlify dashboard: **Forms** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Add notification**
3. Select **Slack notification**
4. Paste your webhook URL
5. Save

### Zapier Integration

1. Create a Zapier account
2. Set up a "Netlify Form Submission" trigger
3. Connect to your email, CRM, or other services
4. Automate follow-ups, CRM entries, etc.

## üìä Viewing Submissions

### In Netlify Dashboard

1. Go to your site
2. Click **Forms**
3. Click **contact** form
4. See all submissions with:
   - Submission date/time

   - Spam status
   - Download as CSV

### Spam Filtering

Netlify automatically filters spam using:
- Honeypot field (bot-field) ‚úì Already in your form

---

## üöÄ Testing the Form

### Local Testing
