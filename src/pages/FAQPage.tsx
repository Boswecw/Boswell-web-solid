    question: "What's the difference between a website and a web app?",
    answer: "A website is primarily informational (marketing, blogs, portfolios). A web app is interactive and functional (dashboards, automation tools, custom systems). We build both, and we'll help you determine which is right for your needs."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical project take?",
    answer: "It depends on complexity. Starter websites: 1-2 weeks. Business websites: 2-3 weeks. eCommerce: 3-5 weeks. Custom web apps: 6-12+ weeks. We provide detailed timelines during the discovery phase."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ongoing support after launch?",
    answer: "Yes! Every project includes 30 days of free support. After that, we offer maintenance packages starting at $500/month for bug fixes, updates, and minor enhancements."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies do you use?",
    answer: "We specialize in modern frameworks: React, Solid, and SvelteKit for frontends. Node.js, FastAPI, and Express for backends. We choose the best tool for each project's specific needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate with existing systems?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We can integrate with APIs, databases, payment processors, CRMs, and other tools. We've successfully integrated with 20+ services including Stripe, Zapier, and custom APIs."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer AI/automation features?",
    answer: "Yes! We specialize in AI integration using LangChain, OpenAI, and TensorFlow. We can build chatbots, automate workflows, add intelligent features, and create custom AI tools."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your pricing model?",
    answer: "We offer fixed-price packages for standard services (Starter: $900-$1,500, Business: $1,800-$3,500, eCommerce: $3,000-$6,000+). Custom projects are quoted based on scope and complexity."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide hosting?",
    answer: "We deploy to Netlify, Render, or your preferred cloud provider. We can also help you set up custom cloud infrastructure on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with SEO?",
    answer: "Yes. We build SEO-optimized sites with proper meta tags, structured data, sitemaps, and performance optimization. We also provide SEO recommendations and can help with ongoing optimization."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need changes after launch?",
    answer: "We're here for you! We offer maintenance packages, hourly support, or project-based enhancements. Most clients stay with us for ongoing improvements and new features."
