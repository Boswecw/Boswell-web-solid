# Public Product Exposure Rules

This document defines how Forge ecosystem products are represented on the
Boswell Digital Solutions public business website.

This file is AUTHORITATIVE for all website copy, structure, and claims.

The public website is a trust surface, not an operational interface.

---

## Core Rule

The business website must never expose operational, security, or governance
details of internal systems.

No public page may imply that visitors can access, control, or operate
Forge infrastructure.

---

## Product Classification

Forge ecosystem products fall into the following public exposure classes.

### 1. Public Products

Public products may include:
- High-level descriptions
- Feature summaries
- Screenshots or diagrams (non-operational)
- Download links (if applicable)
- Status labels (e.g., Public Preview, Released)

Public products must NOT include:
- Credentials
- APIs or IPC commands
- Internal architecture diagrams
- Security or credential handling details
- Roadmaps with guaranteed dates

---

### 2. Internal / Private Products

Internal or private products may include ONLY:
- A short, high-level description
- The problem the system solves
- Its role in the Forge ecosystem
- A conservative status label (Internal / Private / In Development)
- A contact or inquiry call-to-action

Internal or private products must NEVER include:
- Access instructions
- Architecture diagrams
- Security models
- Credential handling
- Environment variables
- APIs, IPC commands, or integration details
- Feature roadmaps with delivery dates
- Version numbers implying availability

---

## Forge Command Classification

Forge Command is an INTERNAL operational control system.

On the public business website, Forge Command may be represented ONLY as:

- A high-level product overview (1–2 paragraphs maximum)
- A description of its role as internal mission control
- A status label: Internal / Private
- A contact or enterprise inquiry CTA

Forge Command must NOT expose:
- Security models
- Credential vault behavior
- IPC command lists
- Environment variables
- Governance pipelines
- Operational controls
- Screenshots implying access
- Any language suggesting availability or purchase

---

## Authority Boundary

The business website must never imply that visitors can:

- Access Forge Command
- Execute operations
- Obtain credentials or API keys
- Bypass governance layers
- Control Forge systems directly or indirectly

Any copy or UI that implies authority, access, or control is a HARD FAILURE.

---

## Required Boundary Language

Where products interface conceptually with Forge infrastructure, the following
boundary statement MUST be included verbatim:

> “This product does not grant access to ForgeCommand, Forge:SMITH,
> or internal governance systems.”

---

## Enforcement

These rules are binding for:
- Website copy
- Page structure
- Navigation labels
- Product descriptions
- Shop listings
- Marketing language

Any refactor, automation, or AI-assisted change that violates these rules
must be rejected.

---

## Intent

These rules exist to ensure:
- Clear trust boundaries
- No accidental disclosure
- No implied authority
- Defensible public claims
- Long-term credibility

The website explains WHAT exists — not HOW it operates.
